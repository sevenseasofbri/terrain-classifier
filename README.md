## CS5272 Embedded Systems Project Repository

This repository contains the project files for our **CS5272 Embedded Systems** course project.

### ðŸ“‚ Folder Descriptions

- **`data-vibration/`**  
  Contains recorded vibrational signals collected over various surfaces.

- **`data/`**  
  Contains recorded audio signals captured across different surfaces.

- **`data-collection/`**  
  Scripts for recording audio and converting it into the desired format.

- **`demo/`**  
  Photos and videos of the experimental setup and demonstration materials.

- **`hdc/`**  
  Code for training (on a regular computer) and inference (on a microcontroller) using the **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)** paradigm on both audio and vibration sensor data.

- **`mcu_inference/`**  
  Code for deploying inference code on micro-controller and latency and memory measurement with static data files.

- **`mcu_live_inference/`**  
  Code for deploying inference code on micro-controller with live audio and vibration data capture.

- **`meas/`**
